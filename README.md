I felt like if nobody was going to make a tool like this I was gonna be the one to make it, so here you go:

# Basics
You can input any top and bottom text, or also only one of them, and everything will be generated according to how it'd look in game

# Speed
Don't like the default speed (15 ms)? You can adjust that too

# Customization
Further more, you can use a custom color or background (resize it to 1800x600p for best results)

This is my first GitHub repository so I don't know what else to add, have a good one
